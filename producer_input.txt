Man's dearest possession is life.
It is given to him but once, 
and he must live it so as to feel no torturing regrets for wasted years, 
never know the burning shame of a mean and petty past; 
so live that, dying, 
he might say: all my life, 
all my strength were given to the finest 
cause in all the world—the fight for the Liberation of Mankind.
